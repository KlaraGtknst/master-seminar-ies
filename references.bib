	abstract = {How can you sample good negative examples for contrastive learning? We argue that, as with metric learning, contrastive learning of representations benefits from hard negative samples (i.e., points that are difficult to distinguish from an anchor point). The key challenge toward using hard negatives is that contrastive methods must remain unsupervised, making it infeasible to adopt existing negative sampling strategies that use true similarity information. In response, we develop a new family of unsupervised sampling methods for selecting hard negative samples where the user can control the hardness. A limiting case of this sampling results in a representation that tightly clusters each class, and pushes different classes as far apart as possible. The proposed method improves downstream performance across multiple modalities, requires only few additional lines of code to implement, and introduces no computational overhead.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01028},
	abstract = {Contrastive learning has become a key component of self-supervised learning approaches for computer vision. By learning to embed two augmented versions of the same image close to each other and to push the embeddings of different images apart, one can train highly transferable visual representations. As revealed by recent studies, heavy data augmentation and large sets of negatives are both crucial in learning such representations. At the same time, data mixing strategies either at the image or the feature level improve both supervised and semi-supervised learning by synthesizing novel examples, forcing networks to learn more robust features. In this paper, we argue that an important aspect of contrastive learning, i.e., the effect of hard negatives, has so far been neglected. To get more meaningful negative samples, current top contrastive self-supervised learning approaches either substantially increase the batch sizes, or keep very large memory banks; increasing the memory size, however, leads to diminishing returns in terms of performance. We therefore start by delving deeper into a top-performing framework and show evidence that harder negatives are needed to facilitate better and faster learning. Based on these observations, and motivated by the success of data mixing, we propose hard negative mixing strategies at the feature level, that can be computed on-the-fly with a minimal computational overhead. We exhaustively ablate our approach on linear classification, object detection and instance segmentation and show that employing our hard negative mixing procedure improves the quality of visual representations learned by a state-of-the-art self-supervised learning method.},

PCL not only learns low-level features for the task of instance discrimination, but more importantly, it implicitly encodes semantic structures of the data into the learned embedding space. Specifically, we introduce prototypes as latent variables to help find the maximum-likelihood estimation of the network parameters in an Expectation-Maximization framework. We iteratively perform E-step as finding the distribution of prototypes via clustering and M-step as optimizing the network via contrastive learning. We propose ProtoNCE loss, a generalized version of the InfoNCE loss for contrastive learning, which encourages representations to be closer to their assigned prototypes. PCL outperforms state-of-the-art instance-wise contrastive learning methods on multiple benchmarks with substantial improvement in low-resource transfer learning.

	abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for analyzing graph data on the web and beyond. Contrastive learning (CL), a self-supervised paradigm, not only mitigates reliance on annotations but also has potential in performance. The hard negative sampling strategy that benefits CL in other domains proves ineffective in the context of Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) due to the message passing mechanism. Embracing the subspace hypothesis in clustering, we propose a method towards expansive and adaptive hard negative mining, referred to as G raph contR astive leA rning via subsP ace prE serving (GRAPE ). Beyond homophily, we argue that false negatives are prevalent over an expansive range and exploring them confers benefits upon GCL. Diverging from existing neighbor-based methods, our method seeks to mine long-range hard negatives throughout subspace, where message passing is conceived as interactions between subspaces. \%Empirical investigations back up this strategy. Additionally, our method adaptively scales the hard negatives set through subspace preservation during training. In practice, we develop two schemes to enhance GCL that are pluggable into existing GCL frameworks. The underlying mechanisms are analyzed and the connections to related methods are investigated. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms across diverse graph datasets and remains competitive across varied application scenarios{\textbackslash}footnoteOur code is available at https://github.com/zz-haooo/WWW24-GRAPE. .},

	abstract = {Contrastive Learning (CL) has emerged as a dominant technique for unsupervised representation learning which embeds augmented versions of the anchor close to each other (positive samples) and pushes the embeddings of other samples (negatives) apart. As revealed in recent studies, CL can benefit from hard negatives (negatives that are most similar to the anchor). However, we observe limited benefits when we adopt existing hard negative mining techniques of other domains in Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL). We perform both experimental and theoretical analysis on this phenomenon and find it can be attributed to the message passing of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Unlike CL in other domains, most hard negatives are potentially false negatives (negatives that share the same class with the anchor) if they are selected merely according to the similarities between anchor and themselves, which will undesirably push away the samples of the same class. To remedy this deficiency, we propose an effective method, dubbed {\textbackslash}textbf\{ProGCL\}, to estimate the probability of a negative being true one, which constitutes a more suitable measure for negatives' hardness together with similarity. Additionally, we devise two schemes (i.e., {\textbackslash}textbf\{ProGCL-weight\} and {\textbackslash}textbf\{ProGCL-mix\}) to boost the performance of GCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProGCL brings notable and consistent improvements over base GCL methods and yields multiple state-of-the-art results on several unsupervised benchmarks or even exceeds the performance of supervised ones. Also, ProGCL is readily pluggable into various negatives-based GCL methods for performance improvement.

	abstract = {Contrastive learning, which pulls positive pairs closer and pushes away negative pairs, has remarkably propelled the development of self-supervised representation learning. Previous studies either neglected negative sample selection, resulting in suboptimal performance, or emphasized hard negative samples from the beginning of training, potentially leading to convergence issues. Drawing inspiration from curriculum learning, we find that learning with negative samples ranging from easy to hard improves both model performance and convergence rate. Therefore, we propose a dynamic negative sample weighting strategy for contrastive learning. Specifically, we design a loss function that adaptively adjusts the weights assigned to negative samples based on the model's performance. Initially, the loss prioritizes easy samples, but as training advances, it shifts focus to hard samples, enabling the model to learn more discriminative representations. Furthermore, to prevent an undue emphasis on false negative samples during later stages, which probably results in trivial solutions, we apply L2 regularization on the weights of hard negative samples. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed weighting strategy. The ablation study confirms both the reasonableness of the curriculum and the effectiveness of the regularization.},

Selecting appropriate samples is critical to effectively train a model, however, existing methods suffer from false or uninformative sample problems. This paper rethinks how to mine samples in contrastive learning and the proposed method is more comprehensive. It takes into account both positive and negative samples, and mines potential samples from two aspects. First, for positive samples, this paper incorporates both the augmented sample views and the mined sample views. A weighted combination of these positive samples is achieved by using both hard and soft weighting strategies simultaneously. Second, considering the existence of false and uninformative negative samples, this paper analyzes the negative samples from the perspective of gradient and mines negative samples that are neither too difficult nor too easy as potential negative samples, i.e., those negative samples that are close to positive samples. Compared with previous state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, experiments show the obvious advantages of the proposed method, and the corresponding top-1 accuracies of linear classification are improved by 0.77\%, 2.39\%, and 1.01\% on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, respectively.
