Researchers usually select self-supervised pre-text tasks such that 
the labels can be generated without human annotations \citet{PIC_2020}.
The pre-text task instance discrimination considers each instance from the dataset its class.
A sample and its augmentations are considered positive pairs, 
while all other samples are considered negative pairs.
Hence, the model acquires an understanding of distinguishing between the instances and 
learns invariance to (image) transformations \citet{PIC_2020,swav_2020,local_aggr_2019,grape_2024,CL_temp_2021}.
