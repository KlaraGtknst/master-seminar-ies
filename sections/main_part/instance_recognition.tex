% SSL
\acf{ssl} is an unsupervised learning technique that allows training models on data without any labels.
This is achieved through the use of pre-text tasks designed to create labels from the unlabelled dataset.
% pre-text task
Researchers usually select self-supervised pre-text tasks such that 
the labels can be generated without human annotations \citet{PIC_2020}.
% instance recognition
One such pre-text task, instance discrimination, treats each instance in the dataset as a distinct class.
% positive and negative samples
In a scenario where a dataset consists of multiple inherent (unlabelled) classes, 
instances from the same class are considered positive pairs, 
while instances from different classes are treated as negative pairs.
% goal
Consequently, the model learns to differentiate between instances and 
develops robustness to (image) transformations
