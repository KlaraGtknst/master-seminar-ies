The selection of positive pairs ($x$, $x^+$) is subject to multiple papers, which propose different strategies.
In the case of unsupervised learning, generally, the positive sample $x^+$ is generated by applying a transformation to the anchor $x$.
Popular augmentation techniques include random cropping, color jittering, rotation and scaling \cite{ho_contrastive_2020,robinson_contrastive_2021}.

% PU learning
Another approach is to use so-called \ac{pu} learning, where learning is carried out on a set of positive and a set of unlabeled samples \cite{chuang_debiased_2020}.
