\subsection{Sample via clustering}
\label{subsec:SampleViaClustering}
Since \ac{cl} objectives are often formulated in terms of distances or similarities between pairs of samples, 
the idea of using clustering techniques is a natural choice.
Intuitively, clusters of similar samples should be considered as positive samples and thus,
should be encoded close to each other.
Conversely, samples from different clusters should be encoded far apart.
