\subsection{Sample via clustering}
\label{subsec:SampleViaClustering}

The choice of clustering methods to optimize \ac{cl} objectives 
arises naturally from the fact that positive pairs ought to be close 
to each other in the embedding space 
while samples of negative pairs ought to repel each other.
Intuitively, clusters of similar samples are considered positive samples.
Conversely, samples from different clusters are denoted negative samples.

Simple approaches, including \ac{drc} \citet{DRC_2020}, aim to create low intra-class diversity clusterings. 
To this end, they consider both the \ac{af}, obtained from a \ac{cnn} with a fully connected layer, 
and the \ac{ap}, calculated via the softmax function of the \ac{af}, 
during clustering using a dedicated loss function.
This approach is motivated by their claim that existing methods cluster dissimilar \ac{af} together,
due to the usage of the maximum sensitivity of the softmax function used during cluster assignment.

Opposed to methods such as \ac{drc}, \ac{swav} does not directly encourage similar embeddings 
but similar 
cluster assignments for positive pairs \citet{swav_2020}.
The idea is to swap the assignments between two positive samples of the same image to encourage 
similar cluster assignments for similar instances.
A positive sample is obtained by applying a random augmentation to the anchor.
