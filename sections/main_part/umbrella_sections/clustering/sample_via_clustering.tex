\subsection{Sample via clustering}
\label{subsec:SampleViaClustering}

The choice of clustering methods to optimize \ac{cl} objectives 
arises naturally from the fcats that positive pairs ought to be close to each other in the embedding space 
while samples of negative pairs ought to repel each other.
Intuitively, clusters of similar samples should be considered as positive samples.
Conversely, samples from different clusters should be encoded far apart.

Simple approaches, including \ac{drc} \citet{DRC_2020}, aim to create low intra-class diversity clusterings 
by considering both the \ac{af}, obtained from a \ac{cnn} with a fully connected layer, 
and the \ac{ap}, obtained from the softmax function, during clustering via a dedictated loss function.
This approach is motivated by their claim that existing methods cluster dissimilar feature space 
representations \ac{af} together,
due to the usage of the maximum sensitivity of the softmax function used during cluster assignment.

Opposed to other methods such as \ac{drc}, \ac{swav} does not directly encourage similar embeddings but similar 
cluster assignments for positive pairs \citet{swav_2020}.
The idea is to swap the assignments between the two views of the same image to encourage 
similar cluster assignments for similar instances.
The positive sample is obtained by applying a random augmentation the anchor.
