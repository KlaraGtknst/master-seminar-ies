\subsubsection{Choosing the hardness of negative samples}\label{subsec:choose_hardness}

\citet{robinson_contrastive_2021} 
extend \citet{chuang_debiased_2020}'s approach to sampling from distributions of image data.
Again, sampling from the positive sample distribution is approximated by sampling from a set of transformations
while negative samples $x^-$ are obtained by sampling from the data distribution $p$.

\citet{robinson_contrastive_2021} introduce the concentration parameter $\beta$ 
to enable user-specific hardness of the negative samples.
$\beta$ is a multiplicative factor for the similarity, i.e. dot product $\beta f(x)^\text{T}f(x^-)$, 
of feature space representations of two samples.
Hence, large values of $\beta$ lead to sampling very hard negative samples and thus, 
increase the risk of sampling \acp{fn}.
