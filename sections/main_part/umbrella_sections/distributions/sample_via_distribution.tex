\subsection{Sample from distributions}
\label{subsec:SampleViaDistribution}
% TODO: Was sollen Verteilungen abbilden? Was approximieren sie? Warum sampeln? Intuition

Assuming the distribution of a variable $x$ is known, it is possible to sample from it.
Sampling can either be done directly or 
via approximation schemes such as rejection sampling and Monte Carlo sampling \citet{robinson_contrastive_2021} .
However, in the context of \ac{cl}, the true data distribution of the different classes is often not available 
due to the nature of unsupervised learning scenarios.
Therefore, some scientists formulate assumptions or simplify the problem.
