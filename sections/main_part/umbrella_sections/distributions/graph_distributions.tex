\subsubsection{Graphs}\label{subsec:graph_distribution}

Another prominent data structure is graphs, which can model 
for instance social networks, citation networks, or knowledge graphs.
\citet{progcl_2022} propose an approach to mine negative samples for \ac{cl} on graphs called \progcl{}. 
As a motivation, the authors compare the similarity between the anchor and \acp{tn} 
to the similarity between the anchor and \acp{fn} 
across multiple datasets for both conventional \ac{cl} and \ac{gcl}.
The resulting distributions shown in \autoref{fig:sim_t_f_neg_image_graph} 
indicate that for \ac{gcl} the majority of highly similar negative samples are \acp{fn}, 
while for conventional \ac{cl} there seems to be no clear trend.
Moreover, the authors found that both the \ac{tn} and \ac{fn} distributions are best modeled by a \ac{bmm} 
since it is able to fit the skewed empirical distribution.
The distribution is fitted using the \ac{em} algorithm on a subset of samples for a reduction of computational costs.

% scheme 1: ProGCL-weight
Based on this observation, the authors propose 
considering both the probability of a sample being a \ac{tn} 
and the sample's similarity to the anchor, i.e. its hardness, during the selection process of negative samples.

% scheme 2: ProGCL-mix (MoCHi)
% \textcolor{red}{move to MoCHi chapter\\}
% \begin{equation}
%     \tilde{h_k} =  \alpha_k \cdot n_i + (1-\alpha_k) \cdot  n_j, \text{ where } \alpha_k = \frac{p(n_i \text{ is } TP)}{p(n_i \text{ is } TP) + p(n_j \text{ is } TP)}
%     \label{eq:progcl_mix}
% \end{equation}

% Furthermore, the authors present an extension of the hard mining strategy \ac{mochi} introduced in \autoref{subsec:MoCHi}.
% They claim, that a high portion of the negative samples generated by \ac{mochi} are \acp{fn}.
% They therefore propose to weigh the selected negative samples for mixing 
% according to their relative probability of being a \ac{tn} as displayed in \eqref{eq:progcl_mix}.
