\subsubsection{Graphs}\label{subsec:graph_distribution}

Another prominent data structure is graphs, which can model 
social networks, citation networks, or knowledge graphs.
\citet{progcl_2022} propose an approach to mine negative samples for \ac{cl} on graphs called \progcl{}. 
As a motivation, the authors compare the similarity between the anchor and \acp{tn} 
to the similarity between the anchor and \acp{fn} 
across multiple datasets for both conventional \ac{cl} and \ac{gcl}.
The resulting distributions shown in \autoref{fig:sim_t_f_neg_image_graph} 
indicate that for \ac{gcl} the majority of highly similar negative samples are \acp{fn}, 
while for conventional \ac{cl} there seems to be no clear trend.
Moreover, the authors found that both the \ac{tn} and \ac{fn} distributions are best modeled by a beta mixture model %\acl{bmm} 
since it is able to fit the skewed empirical distribution.
The distribution is fitted using the \ac{em} algorithm on a subset of samples for a reduction of computational costs.

% scheme 1: ProGCL-weight
Building on this observation, the authors propose incorporating both the probability of a sample being a \ac{tn} and 
the sample's similarity to the anchor, referred to as its hardness, into the negative sample selection process. 
It is important to note that the anchor is not a cluster center, 
but rather the sample from which augmentations are derived.
