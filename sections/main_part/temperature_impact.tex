The parameter $\tau$ is called temperature.
\citet{grape_2024} have worked on a contrastive learning approach on graphs called \ac{grape}.
According to \citeauthor{grape_2024}, small values of $\tau$ lead to strong repulsive forces on neighboring samples.
Larger values of $\tau$, on the other hand, exert weaker repulse forces.
