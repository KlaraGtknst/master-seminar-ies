\subsection{Debiased Contrastive Learning}\label{subsec:debiasing_cl}

\citet{chuang_debiased_2020} propose a debiased contrastive objective that corrects for sampling \acp{fn}, 
i.e., the selection of negative samples that have the same label as the anchor, in an unsupervised scenario.
They denote sampling bias the phenomenon where anchor $x$ and negative sample $x^-$ are similar to each other.
When randomly sampling negative samples from the data distribution $p(x)$ 
a negative sample can inherently belong to the same latent class as the anchor.
