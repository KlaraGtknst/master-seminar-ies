\subsection{MoCHi}\label{subsec:MoCHi}

\citet{mochi_2020} state that most approaches to sampling negatives rely on 
time-consuming updates of a memory bank or big batches to achieve good performance.
They propose a method that computes samples online while claiming they introduce no computational overhead.

% memory bank
They use a memory bank $Q$ of size $| Q | = K$ to store negative samples.
There are different ways to choose $K$ by either saving the whole dataset, a queue of last batches,
or all images in the current batch.
