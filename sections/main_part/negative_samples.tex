% unsupervised learning
Simple selection techniques of negative samples include uniform sampling from the dataset or batch.
However, this approach is prone to two issues \cite{robinson_contrastive_2021}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Selected samples are not necessarily hard negatives since the approach does not consider the embedding space proximity.
    \item Selected samples might actually belong to the same class and thus, can be denoted \ac{fn}.
\end{enumerate}
