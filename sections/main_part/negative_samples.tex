% unsupervised learning
Simple selection techniques of negative samples include uniform sampling from the dataset or batch.
However, this approach is prone to two issues \citet{robinson_contrastive_2021,mining_potential_2024}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Selected samples are not necessarily hard negatives since the approach does not consider the embedding space proximity.
    \item Selected samples might actually belong to the same class as the anchor and thus, can be denoted \ac{fn}.
\end{enumerate}

% oracle learning
Some approaches use a so-called class oracle to boost the performance of the model.
If \acp{fn} \cite{grape_2024,curricular_weighting_2024,progcl_2022}, i.e. samples considered negative that belong to the latent class of the anchor,
 are sampled during hard negative mining samples of the same class are pushed further apart in the embedding space. 
To avoid performance deterioration, this approach removes the \acp{fn} from the set of negative samples and thus, 
increases the performance of the model \citet{mochi_2020}.
