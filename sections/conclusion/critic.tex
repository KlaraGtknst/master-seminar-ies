\section{Critic}\label{sec:critic}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item many papers, but often used just random transformations, which is boring -> kNN
    \item manifold mining is interesting, but manifold calculated only once at beginning
    \item clustering-based approaches eg. \ac{pcl} seemed to need $M$ clusterings per iteration 
    which seems computationally expensive. Batch verändert komplettes embedding/ model
    \item usage of cosine similarity is questionable, since vector direction is compared and 
    not the magnitude, right? YES
    \item distances on high dimensional spaces are not well defined, right? curse of dimensionality -> distances become meaningless -> dim reduction
    \item braucht man $L_{ap}$ bei DRC überhaupt?
\end{enumerate}
