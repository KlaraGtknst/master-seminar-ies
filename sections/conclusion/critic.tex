% TODO: braucht man L_ap bei DRC Ã¼berhaupt?

\begin{enumerate}
    \item many papers, but often used just random transformations, which is boring -> kNN
    \item manifold mining is interesting
    \item clustering-based approaches seemed to need $M$ clusterings per iteration 
    which seems computationally expensive. Batch verÃ¤ndert komplettes embedding/ model
    \item usage of cosine similarity is questionable, since vector direction is compared and 
    not the magnitude, right? YES
    \item distances on high dimensional spaces are not well defined, right? curse of dimensionality -> distances become meaningless -> dim reduction
\end{enumerate}
