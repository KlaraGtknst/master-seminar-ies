% unsupervised learning
Simple selection techniques of negative samples include uniform sampling from the dataset or batch.
However, this approach is prone to two issues \citet{robinson_contrastive_2021,mining_potential_2024}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Selected samples are not necessarily hard negatives since the approach does not consider the embedding space proximity.
    \item Selected samples might actually belong to the same class as the anchor and thus, can be denoted \ac{fn}.
\end{enumerate}

% oracle learning
If \acp{fn} \cite{grape_2024,curricular_weighting_2024,progcl_2022}, i.e. 
samples that belong to the same latent class as the anchor but are incorrectly treated as negatives, 
are selected during hard negative mining, 
this results in samples from the same class being pushed farther apart in the embedding space. 
Such incorrect separation can degrade the quality of the learned representations 
by disrupting the model's ability to cluster similar instances effectively.
% To avoid performance deterioration, the so-called class oracle approach 
% removes the \acp{fn} from the set of negative samples and thus, 
% increases the performance of the model \citet{mochi_2020}.
