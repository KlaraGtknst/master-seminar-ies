In order to explain why the proximity of generated samples to the anchor is relevant to the efficiency during training, 
one can consider a simple example in Euclidean space.
Imagine images as input to a \ac{nn}, which projects them onto $f_{\theta}(x) \in \mathbb{R}^d$, where $theta$ are the parameters of the \ac{nn}.
