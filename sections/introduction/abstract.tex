    Unsupervised learning techniques are of interest to many researchers, as they allow training models on data without any labels.
    Self-supervised learning is a subset of unsupervised learning, where labels are generated from unlabelled training data.
    \ac{cl} is a self-supervised learning technique that is frequently used in representation learning.
    The representations of similar samples are supposed to be encoded within close range of each other, 
    while the representations of dissimilar samples are pushed apart.
    The selection of these dis-/similar pairs is subject to research.
    This paper reviews different approaches for finding sample pairs in \ac{cl}, with a focus on hard sample mining.
