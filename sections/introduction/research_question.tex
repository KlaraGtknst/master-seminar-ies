% CL
In the context of \acf{cl}, 
the representations of similar samples are expected to be encoded in close proximity, 
while those of dissimilar samples are pushed farther apart 
\citet{mining_potential_2024}.
% application/ relevance
\ac{cl} should enhance representation learning 
by improving both its overall quality and robustness \citet{mochi_2020}.
% purpose of this work 
To this end, this work presents different sampling techniques for 
positive and negative samples in \ac{cl}.
