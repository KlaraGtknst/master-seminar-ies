% CL
In the context of \acf{cl}, 
the representations of similar samples are supposed to be encoded 
within close range of each other, 
while the representations of dissimilar samples are pushed apart.
% application/ relevance
Hence, \ac{cl} ought to improve representation learning in terms of 
general quality and robustness \citet{mochi_2020}.
% purpose of this work 
To this end, this work presents different sampling techniques for 
positive and negative samples in \ac{cl}.
